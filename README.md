# Plaintext for Obsidian

Obisidan (https://obsidian.md) plugin that allows it to open files as plaintext.
Developed for Obsidian version 0.12.12. It might work with older versions, but it is not tested.

Code is functional! You can actually edit plaintext files now. There's no fancy syntax highlighting, since the file 
is interpreted as plaintext, as opposed to some other type of text.
